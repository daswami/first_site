            <p>Hazel is a year-old yellow Labrador retriever that enjoys long walks and playing catch (in or out of the water). She has a lot of energy, so she gets restless if she does not have enough exercise. Hazel loves meeting new people and seeing old friends. She likes to jump on people, but she is friendly and does not mean any harm.</p>
            <p>Hazel will eat anything and everything. Like most Labrador retrievers, she loves food and will eat things that are not actually edible. Some of the things that Hazel has chewed on include hand towels, blankets, Apple Airpods, and Halloween decorations. She also loves to eat human food such as lettuce.</p>

            <p>Jazz is a small Yorkshire terrier who lives in Bedford Massachusetts. He is 12 years old.</p>
            <p>Jazz spends most of his time lying on the couch. He doesnâ€™t have the energy he used to have when he was younger. His favorite foods include cheese, steak, yogurt. He likes it when we mix steak juices with his kibble.</p>
